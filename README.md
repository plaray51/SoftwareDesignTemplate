# SoftwareDesignTemplate

**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The scenario is that you work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant. First, you introduced your client, The Gaming Room, to different approaches they can use as they expand their game onto various operating systems. You then explained the integration of the client’s game in a distributed environment. Now, you will explain how to apply the client’s needs to the architectures of the different operating platforms available.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I feel as though I completed everything that was required in the document

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
I thought it was easy how it was broken down step by step and had a template. I am not sure what it means developing code. No code was developed for this.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
The final part where I should have recommended an operating platform. Client-server is appropriate

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I did the best I could with going with what the customer needed. It is important to do that so that everyone involved has the best experience possible.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
No actual software was designed for this project so I am not entirely sure what this question is asking. This was a software design template that is to be filled out.
